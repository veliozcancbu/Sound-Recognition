# Sound Recognition

An application that captures real-time audio recordings from the user's microphone and saves them to the device, and when the recorded file is selected, it predicts the identity of the person speaking.

The audio recording captured from the microphone is converted into a Waveform and displayed to the user. If desired, the user can save this waveform to their device. They can also perform interactive analyses on the waveform.

It predicts the emotions of a person who is speaking using trained emotion models.
